In the years ahead companies as well as governments must find innovative ways to address important issues within this field without sacrificing basic needs such as safety of drinking water or the reliability of water for energy production. Nobody understands this better than author Neil Grigg a forty-year veteran of the water industry and now with <br>Water Finance<br> he shares his extensive experience with you.<br> Most of the water business operates under the radar but with this reliable resource Grigg shines a bright light on this essential area and offers comprehensive coverage of the public responsibilities and private opportunities associated with it. While <br>Water Finance<br> does contain many facts and figures it also takes the time to pull together the various aspects of water going far beyond water as just a commodity to skillfully explain it as the integrated business that it is .<br> <br>Opens with a detailed discussion of the water industry before turning its focus to water handling which includes water supply wastewater industrial water storm water irrigation and drainage and instream flows<br> Reveals the different driving forces and issues surrounding the water industry such as government involvement privatization law and regulations financial structure water and health and workforce capacity<br> Offers insights on water industry business careers and investments<br> <br >Organized around the idea that the water business is about all aspects of handling water from the global environment to your tap <br>Water Finance<br> contains the information you need to succeed in this dynamic field.<br> New feature <br>Praise for WATER FINANCE<br> "Neil Grigg provides a very accessible overview of the many players involved in water and their many connections. His concept of "water handlers" helps bring some order to the water business?an excellent introduction for all those interested in the "business of water.""<br> ?Frank Rijsberman Director Water Sanitation and HygieneBill & Melinda Gates Foundation"s Global Development Program<br> "If you want to really understand the big picture of the drinking water business this is the book to read. Neil"s four decades of experience working and volunteering in the water community?from the water source all the way to the customer"s tap?help the reader to understand the intricacies and challenges of business management at the global and local level. Not only does Neil"s writing style speak to the business community but his writing reaches out and touches the women and men on the front line of providing reliable and safe drinking water to the public."<br> ?Robert C. Renner Executive Director  Water Research Foundation<br> “Dr. Grigg provides an expansive discussion of the complex framework and issues related to water management in a world where water availability will have critical influence on our future lifestyles and the environment that surrounds our cities and farms as well as cultural and recreational uses. He adroitly recognizes that the current lack of political will and a cogent framework in which a reasonable balance between competing interests is a limiting factor in transitioning past practices to those that will be required in an increasingly resource-constrained twenty-first century."<br > ?Peter D. Binney PE Director Sustainable Infrastructure Merrick & Company<br> “Water is a commodity and a natural resource. In Water Finance Neil Grigg delves into the dual nature of our water conveyance systems introducing the reader to the "business of water" and outlining the separate facets that make water resource management different and more complex than just a commodity industry."<br > ?Elizabeth Cutright Editor Water Efficiency magazine<br> "This interesting book is a must for water sector academics professionals and decision-makers. Many related graphs by the author are very illustrative and explain the major messages and views. Although there is emphasis on the U.S. there are also many examples from other parts of the global village."<br> ?Tapio S.
